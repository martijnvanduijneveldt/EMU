# EMU Software Setup Guide

This is a provisional sofware setup guide for the EMU using Happy Hare v3. Happy Hare is an open-source filament changer controller for multi-color printing and is required for the EMU to function.

This guide is meant to be read in conjunction with the Happy Hare guides as found here: https://github.com/moggieuk/Happy-Hare/wiki and with Esoterical's CANBus setup guide as found here: https://canbus.esoterical.online.

## Next Steps
Once you have completed the guide above you should have a fully functioning EMU unit! Optionally you can also set up:
1. Klipper screen integration: https://github.com/moggieuk/Happy-Hare/wiki/KlipperScreen
2. Mainsail / Fluid MMU panel: https://github.com/moggieuk/Happy-Hare/wiki/Mainsail-Fluidd-Integration
3. Spoolman: https://github.com/moggieuk/Happy-Hare/wiki/Spoolman-Support
